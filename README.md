# The Juice Laundry - Website

A responsive HTML/CSS/JavaScript website for The Juice Laundry, featuring:

- Responsive design for all device sizes
- Interactive menu with smoothies, juices, bowls, and boosters
- Shopping cart functionality
- Checkout process
- Modern animations and transitions

This website uses:
- HTML5
- CSS3 with modern features like CSS variables, flexbox, and grid
- Vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)
- Bootstrap 5 for the responsive grid and components
- Font Awesome for icons

Note: I did use AI assist at times to brainstorm and cleanup the syntax.
